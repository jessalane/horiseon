# <horiseonJAL>

## Description

With this project I've edited the provided code to include semantic elements for screen readers. I've also condensed the CSS to eliminate repeated codes, and included some notes for easier navigation. One link, in the header, wasn't directing to the proper section, so that error was also rectified. 

## Usage
The following is a picture of what the website should look like when opened in a browser. 
```md
    ![horiseon screenshot](./assets/images/horiseon%20screenshot.png)
```
